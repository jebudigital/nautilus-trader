# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive crypto algorithmic trading engine built on the open-source Nautilus framework. The system will implement multiple sophisticated trading strategies including Uniswap lending, delta-neutral strategies across centralized exchanges (Binance) and decentralized perpetual platforms (dYdX). The engine will provide automated execution, risk management, and portfolio optimization across both centralized and decentralized finance protocols.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a crypto trader, I want a robust trading engine foundation, so that I can develop, test, and deploy algorithmic strategies through backtesting, paper trading, and live trading modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the engine SHALL initialize Nautilus framework components successfully
2. WHEN in backtesting mode THEN the system SHALL process historical data and simulate strategy execution
3. WHEN in paper trading mode THEN the system SHALL connect to live data feeds but execute simulated orders
4. WHEN in live trading mode THEN the system SHALL establish secure API connections to Binance, dYdX, and Uniswap
5. IF any connection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
6. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain strategy state and configuration consistency

### Requirement 2: Uniswap Lending Strategy

**User Story:** As a DeFi yield farmer, I want to automatically lend assets on Uniswap, so that I can earn passive income from liquidity provision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market conditions are favorable THEN the system SHALL automatically provide liquidity to selected Uniswap pools
2. WHEN providing liquidity THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal token ratios based on current pool composition
3. WHEN impermanent loss exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL withdraw liquidity automatically
4. IF gas fees exceed profitability threshold THEN the system SHALL delay transactions until conditions improve
5. WHEN liquidity is provided THEN the system SHALL track LP token positions and accumulated fees

### Requirement 3: Delta-Neutral Strategy Implementation

**User Story:** As a sophisticated trader, I want to execute delta-neutral strategies across CEX and DEX, so that I can profit from volatility while minimizing directional risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing delta-neutral strategy THEN the system SHALL maintain net-zero directional exposure across all positions
2. WHEN opening positions THEN the system SHALL simultaneously execute offsetting trades on Binance spot/futures and dYdX perpetuals
3. WHEN portfolio delta deviates from neutral THEN the system SHALL rebalance positions within 30 seconds
4. IF funding rates become favorable THEN the system SHALL adjust position sizes to capture funding arbitrage
5. WHEN volatility increases THEN the system SHALL scale position sizes according to predefined risk parameters

### Requirement 4: Risk Management and Position Monitoring

**User Story:** As a risk-conscious trader, I want comprehensive risk controls, so that I can protect my capital from unexpected market movements or system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any position exceeds maximum loss threshold THEN the system SHALL immediately close all related positions
2. WHEN system detects unusual market conditions THEN the system SHALL pause new position entries
3. WHEN portfolio value drops below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL liquidate all positions and halt trading
4. IF exchange connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to close positions on available venues
5. WHEN leverage exceeds maximum allowed THEN the system SHALL reduce position sizes automatically

### Requirement 5: Multi-Exchange Order Management

**User Story:** As an algorithmic trader, I want seamless order execution across multiple venues, so that I can optimize execution quality and capture arbitrage opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN placing orders THEN the system SHALL route to the venue with best execution price
2. WHEN orders are partially filled THEN the system SHALL manage remaining quantities intelligently
3. WHEN slippage exceeds tolerance THEN the system SHALL cancel and re-route orders
4. IF order fails on primary venue THEN the system SHALL automatically retry on alternative venues
5. WHEN executing multi-leg strategies THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic execution or proper rollback

### Requirement 6: Performance Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a trader analyzing performance, I want detailed analytics and reporting, so that I can optimize my strategies and track profitability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL record all transaction details with timestamps
2. WHEN calculating performance THEN the system SHALL account for all fees, slippage, and gas costs
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide strategy-specific P&L breakdowns
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert and suggest strategy adjustments
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL export trading data in standard formats for external analysis

### Requirement 7: Backtesting and Historical Analysis

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want comprehensive backtesting capabilities, so that I can validate strategy performance using historical data before risking capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backtests THEN the system SHALL process historical market data from all supported venues
2. WHEN simulating trades THEN the system SHALL apply realistic transaction costs, slippage, and market impact
3. WHEN backtesting DeFi strategies THEN the system SHALL simulate gas costs and blockchain transaction delays
4. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed performance reports with risk metrics
5. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance analysis
6. IF historical data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest minimum data requirements

### Requirement 8: Paper Trading and Live Data Testing

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want to test strategies with live market data without risking capital, so that I can validate real-time performance before going live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in paper trading mode THEN the system SHALL connect to live market data feeds from all venues
2. WHEN executing paper trades THEN the system SHALL simulate order fills based on real market conditions
3. WHEN tracking paper positions THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate simulated portfolio state
4. WHEN paper trading THEN the system SHALL log all would-be transactions for analysis
5. WHEN performance meets criteria THEN the system SHALL allow promotion to live trading
6. IF market conditions change significantly THEN the system SHALL alert users to re-validate strategies

### Requirement 9: Trading Mode Management and Strategy Development

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want seamless transitions between trading modes, so that I can systematically develop and deploy strategies with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching trading modes THEN the system SHALL preserve strategy configurations and parameters
2. WHEN promoting from paper to live THEN the system SHALL require explicit user confirmation
3. WHEN in live trading mode THEN the system SHALL execute real orders with real capital
4. WHEN updating strategy parameters THEN the system SHALL apply changes without restarting the engine
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject changes and maintain current settings
6. WHEN strategy performance degrades THEN the system SHALL suggest returning to paper trading mode

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want to develop and test strategies through a systematic progression from backtesting to live trading, so that I can validate strategy performance before risking real capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in backtesting mode THEN the system SHALL execute strategies against historical data with realistic slippage and fees
2. WHEN backtesting completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive performance metrics and risk analysis
3. WHEN switching to paper trading THEN the system SHALL use live market data but simulate all order executions
4. WHEN in paper trading mode THEN the system SHALL track simulated P&L and positions as if trading live
5. WHEN paper trading validates strategy performance THEN the system SHALL allow promotion to live trading mode
6. WHEN in live trading mode THEN the system SHALL execute real orders with real capital
7. WHEN updating strategy parameters THEN the system SHALL apply changes without restarting the engine
8. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject changes and maintain current settings
